# Teleq

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/riccardomc/teleq)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/riccardomc/teleq)

Teleq, is a project/experiment/diary in golang. After a little less than a year
of professional and private use of golang, I wanted to see where I am at.

With this project I aim to assess what I can do and what I still need to learn
so I can claim I know golang. I guess the goal is to reach a level of comfort
that I have in other languages (Java, Python and C) when dealing with everyday
tasks.

So here are some task that I would like to explore:

1. [Implement a simple data structure](https://github.com/riccardomc/teleq/pull/1)
2. [Serve the data structure via HTTP](https://github.com/riccardomc/teleq/pull/2)
3. [Serialize responses (JSON)](https://github.com/riccardomc/teleq/pull/3)
4. [Serialize requests (JSON)](https://github.com/riccardomc/teleq/pull/4)
5. [Build a CLI to control the behaviour of the server (port number, ...)](https://github.com/riccardomc/teleq/pull/5)
6. Persist the data structure in a database
7. Implement handling multiple data structures
8. Add basic authentication
9. Serve a simple HTML frontend

Each of these points will be implemented following a TDD approach.

I will try to implement each point through a pull request and document the way
I did it. Hopefully I will remember this stuff and maybe someone will find them
useful.
